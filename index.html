            <div class="overview">
              The obesity crisis finds its roots in physical 
              inactivity. Our analysis of <span class="highlight-stat">6,567 records</span> 
              reveals that physical inactivity among 11-17 year 
              olds averages <span class="highlight-stat">83.5%</span>, ranging from 
              <span class="highlight-stat">66.1%</span> to <span class="highlight-stat">94.2%</span>. 
              In some regions, virtually all adolescents are 
              insufficiently active. This represents a fundamental 
              shift in how young people live and move.
            </div>
      <div class="insight">
              <strong>Critical Insight:</strong> Physical inactivity has 
              reached epidemic proportions, fundamentally reshaping 
              how young people live and move throughout the world. 
              In some regions, this figure approaches <span class="highlight-stat">94%</span>. 
              This means virtually no adolescents meet basic 
              physical activity guidelines established by health 
              organizations. We are creating a generation that is 
              both sedentary and at unprecedented risk for chronic 
              diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, 
              and mental health disorders. This crisis represents 
              a complete transformation of adolescent lifestyle patterns.

              The digital revolution has introduced new behavioral

              create new pathways to addiction, directly competing 
              with physical activity. Our analysis reveals a 
              dramatic gender-based digital divide that has 
              completely reversed over time. In 2014, <span class="gender-male">boys</span> 
              dominated gaming with <span class="highlight-stat">54.4%</span> spending 
              excessive time versus <span class="highlight-stat">30.0%</span> of

    <div class="overview">
              By 2022, the digital landscape had transformed 
              completely. Social media platforms created new 
              addiction patterns that favor <span class="gender-female">female</span> 
              engagement. Across 43 European countries, <span class="gender-female">girls</span> 
              consistently show higher problematic social media

              <span class="gender-male">male-dominated gaming</span> to <span class="gender-female">female-dominated</span> 
              social media represents a fundamental transformation

            <div class="insight">
              <strong>Platform-Specific Patterns:</strong> Digital platforms 
              create distinct gender-specific addiction patterns that reflect 
              fundamental differences in how adolescents engage with technology. 
              Gaming platforms favor <span class="gender-male">male engagement</span> 
              while social media platforms favor <span class="gender-female">female</span> 
              engagement, creating unique risk profiles for each gender. This suggests 
              that addiction mechanisms differ significantly between platforms, 
              requiring gender-specific and platform-aware intervention strategies. 
              Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective

              The temporal analysis reveals a global epidemic

              The average increase was <span class="highlight-stat">7.4 percentage</span> 
              points over three decades. This represents not

        <div class="text-content">
    <div class="overview">
            The data reveals a perfect storm converging on 
            adolescent health. A global obesity epidemic affects 
            <span class="highlight-stat">191 out of 192</span> countries, driven by 
            unprecedented physical inactivity rates averaging 
            <span class="highlight-stat">83.5%</span>, and compounded by rapidly 
            evolving digital addiction patterns. Physical inactivity 
            creates the foundation for obesity, while digital 
            behaviors compete with physical activity and introduce 
            new addictive patterns.

      <div class="insight">
            <strong>Integrated Response Needed:</strong> The convergence 
            of these three crises creates an urgent need 
            for integrated policy responses that address 
            the systemic changes reshaping adolescent life. 
            Traditional approaches focused on single risk 
            factors are insufficient for addressing these 
            complex, interconnected challenges facing today's youth.
